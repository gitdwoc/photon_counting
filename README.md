# photon_counting
Codes relevant to photon localiastion on visible light sensors, and image contstructions from such code. 

xraySTORM.py will output csv files of charge cloud properties (and hence x-ray photon properties), given an image with individually resolved charge clouds.

imconstructor.py will use a list of these csv files to construct an image with higher spatial resolution and devoid of detector noise
